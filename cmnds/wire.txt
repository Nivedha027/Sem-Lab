install nmap and wireshark

a) nping --udp --dest-ip 192.168.0.1 -p 2000 --privileged -c 5000000 --data-length 1 --delay 0 -H -N
This is the command line used to generate UDP packets.

b) nping --tcp --dest-ip 192.168.0.1 -p 2000 --privileged -c 5000000 --data-length 1 --delay 0 -H -N
This is the command line used to generate TCP packets.

c) nping --icmp --dest-ip 192.168.0.1 --privileged -c 5000000 --data-length 1 --delay 0 -H -N
This is the command line used to generate UDP packets.
